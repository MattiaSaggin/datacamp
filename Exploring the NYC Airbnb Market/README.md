In New York City there are many Airbnb listings to meet the high demand for temporary lodging for anywhere between a few nights to many months.
Importing, cleaning and exploring 3 different datasets from multiple file types, using Python 
we try to convert untidy data into appropriate formats to analyze and answer key questions like:

- What is the average price, per night, of an Airbnb listing in NYC?
- How does the average price of an Airbnb listing, per month, compare to the private rental market?
- How many adverts are for private rooms?
- How do Airbnb listing prices compare across the five NYC boroughs?
